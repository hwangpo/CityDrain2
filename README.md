# CityDrain2
CITY DRAIN is an open source toolbox for integrated modelling of urban drainage systems realized in Matlab/Simulink. Within a block library different subsystems are provided to describing an integrated urban drainage system and the fluxes of water and matter. 
The software is distributed as free open source software. Users may use the predefined blocks or create new ones fulfilling special purposes of modelling. 
In case you want to get a notice for future bug fixes or new blocks created, leave you mail address at [stefan.achleitner@uibk.ac.at] with the subject/content "CityDrain User".
