CITY DRAIN 2 - Installation guide


1 - The file (CityDrain02.zip) contains the software library (CD2_Library.mdl) 
and all associated functions stored in subdirectories. Alll files including 
subdirectories are to be unpacked and saved preferably in the operating system’s 
programs directory (or any other if wanted).

C:\Programme\CityDrain02\ for German operating system
C:\Program Files\CityDrain02\ for English operating system

2 - For convenient use of City Drain 2.0 it is required to include the CityDrain02 directory (and all subdirectories)
in the Matlab paths. Therefore the Matlab “startup.m” file is to be extended to automatically add the path at every 
startup of Matlab.

C:\Programme\MATLAB6p5\work\startup.m

In case there is no startup.m file created in your Matlab, please create a new startup-file. The code that
is required can be found in CD2_startup.m (see at the end of this install info). The user may modify the 
path of City Drain included in the code for his purpose.

3 - To open the City Drain block library type

> citydrain

in the Matlab command window. Alternative, the Library can be opened via “File/Open…” :

C:\Programs\CityDrain02\CD2_Library.mdl


To set up an own integrated model, blocks are to be copy-pasted to a new mdl-model file.
